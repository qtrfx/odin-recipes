    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup coconut oil</li>
      <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup almond milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees c)</li>
      <li>Cream coconut oil and brown sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until thoroughly mixed, about 5 minutes. Mix in almond milk and vanilla until incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes.r</li>
      <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add the flour mixture to the almond milk mixture, stirring until combined; dough will be crumbly. Fold in chocolate chips.</li>
      <li>Roll the dough into tablespoon-sized balls and place on ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheets. Flatten each ball out a bit with your palm, pressing any crumbs back together.</li>
